# Movie Recommendation System

A **content-based movie recommender** that suggests similar movies using **cosine similarity**.



## 🧠 Overview

It uses **CountVectorizer** and **cosine similarity** to find movies most similar to the one selected by the user.



## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLP (TfidfVectorizer)


## 🔧 How It Works
1. Preprocess and combine key features (overview, genres, cast, etc.).  
2. Convert text data into vectors.  
3. Compute cosine similarity between movies.  
4. Recommend top similar movies.
